        <img src="image/D1.png" class = "rounded float-end mt-3"  style="width: 40rem; height: 30rem" alt="picture">
        <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">Last year, I adopted a ragdoll kitten from New York. He is a smart, sweet, energetic, and healthy kitten. I love everything about him. His breeder started the cattery in 2003. The website was designed at that time, which is outdated. I chose to analyze and redesign this website because the website is not good enough without a picture of my kitten (just kidding).
        </p>
        <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">The website is poorly designed, not only because the color and format are not perfect but also because I had lots of trouble using it. I couldn’t find the information I wanted to know. If this website had an excellent UIUX designer, I would spend much less time communicating with the breeders and have a better idea about what I should do. </p>
        </p>
        <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">Maybe the breeder did this on purpose. He wants his kittens to go to those families who truly care. So only those people who would like to spend lots of time reading this website and asking questions will get a kitten from him. If that is the case, he lost a large group of customers who are loving but busy. Last but not least, I redesigned this website with my love for my cat and my appreciation for the breeder.

      <h3 class = "text-start mt-5">Identifying Usability Problems</h3>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">Here are some usability, learnability, and memorability issues I found:
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">1. The website is not responsive.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">2. The page is too wide. 
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">3. The text is hard to read on the phone.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">4. The text color and background color have low contrast.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">5. The order of items on the navigation bar is not in a logical manner.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">6. The website repeats the same icons many times, such as the castles and the kittens on the top. Users might wonder what those icons mean.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">7. The text is lengthy, without any headings. Users can easily get lost and leave. Users cannot quickly find what they want to know from the long text.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">8. The website mentioned the email and phone number of the breeder. However, the instructions are ambiguous. Users still have no idea what their next step is.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">9. The website mentioned the names of some cats, such as “Brightstone Colton Jaxon Delamer” and “Brightstone Baron Markee Delamer.” Those titles are for cats. It is not intuitive for those who don’t know much about cat competition and bloodlines. I think the designer should try to match the name to the real world.
      </p>

      <h3 class = "text-start mt-5">Identifying Accessibility Problems</h3>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">I agree with the problems detected by WebAIM WAVE.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">1. WebAIM WAVE displays 29 contrast errors, indicating that the text and the background have very low contrast.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">2. WebAIM WAVE shows a warning on no heading.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">3. WebAIM WAVE gives 16 warnings on the navigation bar, meaning that the navigation bar is present that may not be accessible for some devices.
      </p>
      <p class = "mt-3 fs-5">4. WebAIM WAVE says that the website didn’t specify language and was missing alternative text and page regions.
